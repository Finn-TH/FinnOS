Finn's Overhauled Skyrim - My Personal Modlist for Skyrim

![Finn's Overhauled Skyrim Thumbnail](FinnOS-Thumbnail.png)

## Introduction

This is a personal modlist I put together for my own use, sharing it for friends or whomever would like to enjoy it as well. I won't be supporting any issues for it as I'm not that experienced myself; this is just for whoever wants it to improve upon it and for my own personal backup.

## PC System Settings

- **GPU**: 4070 Super
- **CPU**: Ryzen 7600X
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **SSD**: NVME
- **Resolution**: 1440p

**Performance**: 60+ FPS and 100+ FPS with frame generation.

I will be working on converting it to a Wabbajack eventually when I have the time.
